Game v.001
==========

This is a very basic canvas game made with Javascript. The vision is to have a top-down shooter survival game. This is my first game so I am still learning. Hopefully, this will become more advanced as I do so.

Current Features

- Player can move
- Player can shoot and use melee attacks
- Colission detection for player
- Colission detection for bullets
- Level editor added

To run:

Download and open index.html
Movement - W, A, S, D, Up, Down, Left, Right
Ranged Attack - Left Mouse Button
Melee Attack - Right Mouse Button

- Demo - http://www.hookygames.com/Game
- Level Editor - http://www.hookygames.com/Game/snsLevelBuilder.html

I will be updating this pretty frequently. Check back soon!
